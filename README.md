Software Development Engineer
-----------------------------

I have leaned into new technologies for as long as I can remember. I have worked in Software Engineering, Product Management, and even content creation (we didn't call it that then). I love learning, teaching, collaborating and documenting. My latest stack was: FastAPI, Vue, and PostgresDB on Docker, Poetry Library Management, GitHub and AWS on a Kanban team. I also have a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS)🧑‍🎓.
